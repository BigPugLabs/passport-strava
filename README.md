# Passport-Strava

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [Strava](http://www.strava.com/) using OAuth2.

I used [Passport-github](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-github/) as the base for this repo. Really I just changed a few things, the real work was already done.

This module lets you authenticate using Strava in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, Strava authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).


## Install
  
  $ npm install passport-strava
